# Open4X
A data-driven game engine written in c++ and vulkan from scratch.
Currently, this is for my own learning and fun, it is not practically useful

Building on Linux:
First run 'git submodule update --init --recursive'
Just run 'make' in the root directory. This is using 'make' and cmake to minimize the number of commands I need to use to build and run it.
'make run' will run open4x.
